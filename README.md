# Retail-Business-Performance-Profitability-Analysis


This project focuses on analyzing retail transactional data to evaluate business performance and profitability. The objective is to identify profit-draining categories, analyze inventory efficiency, and understand seasonal product behavior to support better business decisions.

Using SQL, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn), and Tableau, the project performs data cleaning, profit calculations, inventory analysis, and correlation analysis between inventory days and profitability. The insights are visualized through an interactive dashboard and summarized in a business-friendly report.
